If you reached this repo via Upwork, please do the following:

1) Create a Branch & name it with your Upwork UserName

2) Pull the Branch to your local machine

3) Install a PHP server (if you do not already have one installed) - NOTE: your .htaccess/web.config may have to be modified - this uses an IIS configuration

4) Create a MySQL db using the .sql file

5) Run the application in your browser. If it doesn't work - make it work. (it should work - this isn't part of the test)

6) Add Phone to CRUD form (field exists in the db)

7) Add Tooltips (styled the same as "front_panel")

8) Hide Add User form and Show/Hide it on button click (styled the same as "front_panel")

When you've done all of the above, create a Pull Request and contact us on Upwork w/ any information we need to know. Feedback is welcome.

Thank you and good luck!
